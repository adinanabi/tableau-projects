## Dataset Source

The dataset used for this dashboard is sourced from the [Netflix Titles Dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/DataScienceRoadMapDSRM/Tableau-Dashboards-info/blob/6eabd6614c1b3e5f793006cbcc6fd9dd03505c55/netflix_titles.csv). It includes detailed information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix, such as title, genre, rating, country, cast, director, and more.

## Data Cleaning Process

The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process to ensure data quality and consistency. Key cleaning steps include:

- Handling missing values (e.g., 'Unknown' for missing director, cast, country).
- Splitting multi-valued columns (e.g., 'listed_in' and 'country') into individual rows for accurate analysis.
- Ensuring the proper data types for fields like 'rating' and 'release year'.
- Creating new calculated fields to handle specific transformations, such as separating duration into numeric and unit components.
